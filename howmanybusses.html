    NAME: Christopher Dillard
    DESCRIPTION: This program will find the number of school busses needed for a field trip.
        NOTES: Maximum 20 riders per bus
                One school van with maximum of 5 riders
                If numbers of riders (or bus overflow) is less than 6, the school van should be used.
                No overloading permitted on any school vehicle.
