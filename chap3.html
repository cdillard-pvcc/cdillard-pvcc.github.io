		<td>TERM</td>
		<td>DEFINITION</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>operating system</td>
		<td>software that controls the operation of a computer. It provides the means by which a user can store and retrieve files, provides the interface by which a user can request the execution of programs, and provides the environment necessary to excute the programs requested.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>job queue</td>
		<td>storage of jobs waiting for execution.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>FIFO</td>
		<td>first-in, first-out. Objects are removed from the queue in the order in which they arrived.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>interactive processing</td>
		<td>operating system that allows program being executed to carry on a dialogue with the user through remote terminals.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>time-sharing multiprocessing</td>
		<td>provide service to multiple users at the same time by dividing time into intervals and then execution of each job is restricted to one interval at a time.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>application software</td>
		<td>programs performing tasks particular to the machine's utilization.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>utility software</td>
		<td>category of system software that consists of programming performing activities that are fundamental to computer installations but not included in the operating system.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>graphical user interface (GUI)</td>
		<td>method of communicating with users in which objects to be manipulated, such as files and programs, are represented pictorially on the display as icons.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>shell</td>
		<td>communicating with users through textual messages using a keyboard and monitor screen.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>kernal</td>
		<td>internal part of the operating system that contains software components that perform the basic functions required by the computer installation.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>device driver</td>
		<td>components of the kernal, which are software units that communicate with the controllers to carry out operations on the peripheral devices attached to the machine.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>file manager</td>
		<td>part of the kernal whose job is to coordinate the use of the machine's mass storage facilities.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>virtual memory</td>
		<td>large "fictional" memory space created by paging.</td>
	</tr>	
	<tr>
		<td>boot strapping</td>
		<td>how the operating system gets started using a procedure that transfers the operating system from mass storage to main memory.</td>
	</tr>	
	<tr>
		<td>ROM</td>
		<td>Read-Only Memory - portion of the computer's main memory where the CPU expects to find its initial program.  ROM is constructed with special nonvolatile memory cells. Contents can be read but not altered.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>deadlock</td>
		<td>the condition in which two or more processes are blocked from progressing because each is waiting for a resource that is allocated to another.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>spooling</td>
		<td>holding data for output at a later, more convenient time.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>super user (or administrator)</td>
		<td>person that establishes accounts and has highly priviledged access to the operating system.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>multi-factor authentication</td>
		<td>require more than one piece of evidence to gain access to a computer or system.</td>
	</tr>
